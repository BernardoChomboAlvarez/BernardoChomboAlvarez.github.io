Hi! I'm Bernardo, an undergraduate student in the Genomic Sciences B.S. programme at the [Center for Genome Sciences](https://www.ccg.unam.mx/en/), National Autonomous University of Mexico ([UNAM](https://www.unam.mx/)). My research and my education are all grounded in the idea that the study of brain genomics and the underlying molecular mechanisms of its physiology will help in the understanding of multiple neurodevelopmental/neurodegenerative disorders' progression, like Alzheimer's Disease. Looking towards the future, this is capable of generating a positive impact in people's health and improving people's quality of life.

## My background and history
I got enrolled in the Biology B.S. programme at the Sciences Faculty, UNAM for one year. Later on, I discovered that pure Biology was not for me and I got enrolled in the Genomic Sciences B.S. programme in which I have had the opportunity to get involved in metagenomics, bionanotechnology, protein engineering, neuroimmunology, stem cells and regeneration, transcriptomics, epigenomics and human populations genomics research lines. More recently, I got accepted in the Vienna BioCenter Summer School for the 2024's summer period. Right now I am finishing my bachelor's formation and looking forward to be a master's (or even better) a Ph.D. candidate in the field of neurogenomics applied to Alzheimer's Disease.

## My research experience
I use computational methods and bioinformatics to automatize processes, analyze experimental data and solve biological problems.

## My intellectual communities
I'm a multitask person, integrating disciplines like computer science, bioinformatics and wet lab techniques. In terms of academic specialities, I spend a lot of time in the fields of processes automatization, big data analysis and I'm keen on network theory applied to systems biology. I often use more probabilistic and statistical forms for data anaylsis and then support them with experimental data. I'm also into a wide range of topics like regeneration, multi-omics, neuroinflammation and Alzheimer's immune response cell markers. In my free time I use different programming languagues to automatize and solve dialy-life issues that can make my life easier.
