Hi! I'm Bernardo, an undergraduate student in the Genomic Sciences B.S. programme at the [Center for Genome Sciences](https://www.ccg.unam.mx/en/), National Autonomous University of Mexico ([UNAM](https://www.unam.mx/)). My research and my education are all grounded in the idea that the study and understanding of neurodevelopmental genomics is capable of generating a positive impact and improving people's quality of life.

## My background and history
When I was in highschool I received the second place in the area of Health
Sciences, Field Research modality, Local category in the XXIX University
Contest, UNAM's Science Fair. Then, after finishing high school, I got enrolled
in the Biology B.S. programme at the Sciences Faculty, UNAM for one year. Later
on, I got accepted in the Genomic Sciences B.S. programme in which I have had the opportunity to get involved in
metagenomics, bionanotechnology, protein engineering, neuroimmunology human
populations genomics research lines. More recently, I got accepted in the Vienna
BioCenter Summer School for the 2024's summer period.

## My research experience
I use computational methods and bioinformatics to automatize processes and analyze experimental data.

## My intellectual communities
I'm a multitask person, integrating disciplines like computer science, bioinformatics and wet lab techniques. In terms of academic specialities, I spend a lot of time in the fields of processes automatization, big data analysis and I'm keen on network theory applied to systems biology. I often use more probabilistic and statistical forms for data anaylsis and then support them with experimental data. I'm also into a wide range of topics like regeneration, cancer cell activation markers and Alzheimer's immune response cell markers.
