Development of a Python and R program for the ΔΔCt analysis of a qPCR output and its normalization with log2FoldChange."

This miscelaneous project intends to create a tool for qPCR data analysis using the Livak method with Pfaffl modification. Here we present an efficient, straight forward and automated tool for data normalization using the ΔΔCT value and amplification efficiency using each amplification curve data.
