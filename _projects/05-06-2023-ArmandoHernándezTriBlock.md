Production of C-S-B Virus-like Proteins for targeted-delivery therapeutic RNA to breast cancer cells."
---

This project aims to produce a hybrid between the C-S-B virus-like protein designed inside the lab (paper) and the another protein that helps to the targeted-delivery of theraputic RNA to tumoral cells. My participation consisted in the recombinant production of tri-block protein and assess its binding specificity to tumor cells. This was actually my first wet lab and I participated in its Summer School. Here I learned basic molecular biology techniques and acquire new laboratory equipment management skills.
