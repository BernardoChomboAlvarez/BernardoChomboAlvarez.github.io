Sensorial neurons and the regulation of immunity in the meninges."

This project aims to study the proinflamatory immune response mediated by the sensorial neurons in meningeal tissues of Alzheimer's disease 5xFAD mice model. My work has consisted in the extraction of meningeal tissues and the assesment of the differential gene expressi√≥n of som proinflamatory citokines by qPCR, as well as the tissue preparation for immunostaining and its processing. Furthermore, I've also contributed with trigeminal ganglion cell-cultures to assess the axonogenesis of the periferal neurons in different stimuli.
