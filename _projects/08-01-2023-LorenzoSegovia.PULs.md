This project aims to compare the diversity of PULs (polysaccharide utilization loci) and the diversity of CAZymes (Carbohydrate Active EnZymes) along the Pacificâ€™s Ocean sediment samples obtained from the CSV of the MAGs from the Nayfach project. This anaylsis took place inside the Institute of Biotechnology of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). The Metagenome Assembled Genomes (MAGs) were obtaines from the [Nayfach project](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27803195/), the PULs substrate data was obtained from [DBcanSub](https://bcb.unl.edu/static/DBCAN-PUL/dbCAN-PUL_v5_05-10-2023.xlsx) and the CAZymes substrate data was obtained from [DBcanPUL](https://bcb.unl.edu/dbCAN_sub/data/fam-substrate-mapping-08252022.tsv).
