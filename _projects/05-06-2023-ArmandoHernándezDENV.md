This project aims to develop a genetic detection system for the four serotypes of *Dengue virus* through CRISPR-Cas12a machinery. My work consisted in the assessment of the designed LAMP primers for the samples amplification as well as the assessment of the sgRNAs for the CRISPR-Cas12a detection. For this project I have developed miscelaneous Python programs for this project, these can be found with the **Miscelaneous** tag inside this page.
